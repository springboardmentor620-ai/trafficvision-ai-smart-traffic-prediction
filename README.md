## 🔍 Project Overview

**TrafficVision AI** is a state-of-the-art urban mobility monitoring console designed to aid city administrators, chief traffic controllers, and field operators. It integrates high-performance AI computer vision models to ingest live or recorded traffic video feeds, extract telemetry, classify vehicles, and automatically determine congestion levels across critical junctions and corridors.

The project implementation is structured across two major completed milestones:
*   **Milestone 1 (Operational Control Core)**: Established the foundational web framework, robust multi-role dashboards (Admin and Operator), secure JWT authentication with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), and cloud database persistence for managing roads, zones, operator assignments, alerts, and operational reporting.
*   **Milestone 2 (AI Computer Vision Integration)**: Introduced OpenCV-based frame extraction, Ultralytics YOLOv8 vehicle detection models, automated vehicle categorization (cars, buses, trucks, motorcycles), and real-time congestion classification. This milestone binds the computer vision results to the Supabase database to dynamically update dashboard visualizations and populate historical traffic analytics.

---

## ⚠️ Problem Statement

Rapidly expanding metropolitan areas are restricted by outdated traffic supervision systems that depend heavily on human oversight, leading to:
1.  **Manual & Fragmented Monitoring**: Operators must manually watch multiple camera feeds, making it easy to miss developing bottlenecks.
2.  **Delayed Congestion Detection**: Traffic backups are often identified only after significant delays, causing cascading traffic jams.
3.  **Lack of Centralized Operator Management**: No unified tool exists to assign controllers to specific roads, leading to gaps in coverage.
4.  **Slow Incident Response**: Escalations for accidents, stalled vehicles, or blocked lanes rely on manual reporting, slowing emergency response times.
5.  **No Intelligent Congestion Analysis**: Traditional telemetry fails to categorize traffic density based on road capacity and vehicle composition.
6.  **Poor Decision Support**: Traffic planners lack historical analytics and predictive reports to optimize traffic signal timings and plan corridor expansions.

---

## 💡 Solution

TrafficVision AI addresses these challenges with a unified, smart city control center:
*   🔒 **Role-Based Access Control**: Secure separation between administrative command and operator field monitoring.
*   📊 **Real-Time Live Monitoring**: Multi-road telemetry dashboards displaying active vehicle counts, average speeds, and status indicators.
*   🛣️ **Corridor & Operator Management**: Comprehensive administrative interfaces to manage road parameters, map-based coordinates, operators, and active duty assignments.
*   🤖 **AI-Based Vehicle Detection**: Automated computer vision processing of road cameras to count and classify passing vehicles.
*   🚦 **Automatic Congestion Detection**: Smart density scoring that triggers instant critical alerts when capacity thresholds are breached.
*   📈 **Historical Analytics & PDF/CSV Reports**: Comprehensive data visualization that aids urban planners in recognizing bottleneck trends.
*   🖥️ **Centralized Dashboard**: A responsive, dark-mode glassmorphic user interface designed for traffic control rooms and mobile field units.

## 🚗 AI Congestion Detection Mechanism

The congestion detection logic maps physical vehicle bounding boxes to actionable administrative states:

1.  **Object Classification (YOLOv8)**:
    The model identifies vehicle categories in every frame and applies a custom "Passenger Car Equivalent" (PCE) weight:
    $$\text{PCE Value} = (\text{Cars} \times 1.0) + (\text{Motorcycles} \times 0.5) + (\text{Buses} \times 2.5) + (\text{Trucks} \times 3.0)$$

2.  **Traffic Density Calculation**:
    The system calculates the traffic density coefficient ($\mathcal{D}$) relative to the road's configured attributes:
    $$\mathcal{D} = \frac{\text{PCE Value}}{\text{Lanes} \times \text{Length (km)}} \times 100$$

3.  **Congestion Category Mapping**:
    *   🔴 **Critical**: $\mathcal{D} \ge 85\%$ *(Speed dropping under 20% limit; triggers immediate operator SMS/email alerts)*
    *   🟠 **High**: $60\% \le \mathcal{D} < 85\%$ *(Moderate speed reduction; logs warning alert)*
    *   🟡 **Moderate**: $35\% \le \mathcal{D} < 60\%$ *(Stable flow with minor delays)*
    *   🟢 **Low**: $\mathcal{D} < 35\%$ *(Free-flow traffic conditions)*

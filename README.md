## ⚠️ Two `auth.py` files — read this before editing either one

This project has **two different files that share the same name**, and mixing them up has been the single most common source of bugs during development:

| File | Contains | Starts with |
|---|---|---|
| `backend/app/auth.py` | Password hashing, JWT creation/validation, RBAC dependencies (`hash_password`, `get_current_user`, `require_admin`, `require_operator_or_admin`) | `from datetime import datetime, timedelta` |
| `backend/app/routers/auth.py` | The actual HTTP endpoints (`/auth/signup`, `/auth/login`, `/auth/me`) | `from fastapi import APIRouter` |

**Before editing or pasting into either file, check which one is open** by looking for `APIRouter` — if you see it in `app/auth.py`, the wrong content has landed there and the server will fail on startup with:
```
AttributeError: module 'app.auth' has no attribute 'get_current_user'
```
Fix: replace `app/auth.py`'s content with the correct version from the **Reference: `app/auth.py`** section near the bottom of this document, verify with:
```powershell
Select-String -Path app\auth.py -Pattern "APIRouter"
```
This must print **nothing**. Then confirm both required functions exist:
```powershell
Select-String -Path app\auth.py -Pattern "def get_current_user|def require_operator_or_admin"
```

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Node.js 18+
- PostgreSQL 14+

---

## Milestone 1 (Week 1–2): Architecture, Auth & RBAC, Live Monitoring

**Delivered:**
- System architecture & PostgreSQL database schema design
- FastAPI backend with JWT authentication
- Role-based access control (originally admin/operator)
- Live traffic monitoring dashboard (React, polling every 5s)
- Congestion tracking workflow with a synthetic sensor data simulator

**Core tables introduced:** `users`, `traffic_zones`, `traffic_data`

**Core endpoints introduced:**

| Method | Endpoint | Access |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/auth/signup` | Public |
| POST | `/auth/login` | Public |
| GET | `/auth/me` | Authenticated |
| POST | `/traffic/zones` | Admin only |
| GET | `/traffic/zones` | Authenticated |
| POST | `/traffic/data` | Authenticated |
| GET | `/traffic/live` | Authenticated |
| GET | `/traffic/history/{zone_id}` | Authenticated |

---

## Milestone 2 (Week 3–4): Congestion Prediction, Route Optimization, Roles, Incidents

**Delivered:**

1. **Dataset & model training** (`ml/` folder)
   - **Source:** [Smart Mobility Traffic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ziya07/smart-mobility-traffic-dataset) (Kaggle, ziya07) — 5,000 records with vehicle counts, speed, road occupancy, traffic light state, weather, accident reports, sentiment, ride-sharing demand, parking availability, emissions, and energy consumption, labeled with a 3-class `Traffic_Condition` target (Low/Medium/High). Chosen over the platform's own simulator output because it includes external/contextual features (weather, accidents, sentiment) the simulator doesn't generate.
   - **Pipeline** (run in order from `ml/`): `01_explore_data.py` → `02_preprocess.py` → `03_train_model.py` → `04_train_production_model.py`. Place the downloaded CSV at `ml/data/smart_mobility_traffic.csv` first.
   - Full EDA — class distribution, correlation heatmap, feature importance (see `ml/eda/EDA_SUMMARY.md`)
   - Trained a RandomForest classifier; a **production-scoped** version (`04_train_production_model.py`) was retrained using only the features the live system can actually supply (vehicle count, speed, occupancy, weather, time) rather than the dataset's full feature set (which includes sentiment, emissions, ride-sharing demand — data this platform doesn't collect). Model artifacts: `congestion_model.joblib`, `target_encoder.joblib`, `weather_encoder.joblib` (copied into `backend/app/` for serving).
   - **Honest finding on accuracy**: ~99.9% accuracy on a held-out test split — unusually high for a real-world traffic task, and worth acknowledging directly. `Vehicle_Count`, `Road_Occupancy_%`, and `Traffic_Speed_kmh` alone account for ~83–90% of feature importance combined, while weather and time-of-day each contribute under 1.5%. This strongly suggests the dataset's `Traffic_Condition` label was generated as a near-deterministic function of those three columns rather than sourced from messy real-world observations — in genuinely noisy real-world data, 75–90% accuracy would be more typical and more trustworthy. **How to present this well**: frame the high accuracy as proof the modeling pipeline works correctly end-to-end (data loading → feature engineering → training → evaluation), while being upfront that validating against real-world or longer-running self-generated data is the natural next step for a more realistic figure.

2. **Congestion prediction API + UI**
   - `POST /predict/congestion` — takes vehicle count, speed, occupancy, weather, hour, weekday/weekend
   - `GET /predict/reports` — every prediction is logged as a report
   - Frontend `/prediction` page: sliders, weather dropdown, time-of-day selector, quick-scenario presets (Free Flow / Moderate / Rush Hour / Storm Gridlock)

3. **Route optimization**
   - `POST /routes/optimize` — calls OSRM for alternate routes between two zones, ranks them by a congestion-adjusted ETA (using a city-wide average of recent congestion as a proxy multiplier)
   - Chosen over Google Maps specifically because it needs no billing/API key — OpenStreetMap is one of the three tech-stack options named in the original project spec
   - Frontend `/routes` page: origin/destination pickers, clickable route list, interactive Leaflet map with route polylines
   - **Saved Routes**: any authenticated user can save an origin/destination pair (`POST /routes/saved`, `GET /routes/saved`, `DELETE /routes/saved/{id}`) for quick reuse

4. **Three-role system + security fix**
   - Roles: `admin`, `operator`, `user` (previously just admin/operator)
   - Public self-registration (`/signup` page) lets new users choose **Public User** or **Traffic Operator** — never **Admin**
   - **Bootstrap-admin pattern**: only the very first account ever created can self-assign `admin`; every signup after that is capped at operator/user regardless of what role is requested. This closed a real privilege-escalation gap where the original endpoint let anyone pass `"role": "admin"`.
   - Live password strength meter on signup (length + character variety heuristic)

5. **Incident reporting**
   - `POST /incidents` — operators/admins only (`require_operator_or_admin` dependency)
   - `GET /incidents` — any authenticated role can view active incidents
   - `PATCH /incidents/{id}/resolve` — operator/admin marks resolved
   - Frontend `/incidents` page: report form (hidden for regular users), active incident list with severity badges

6. **Role visibility & city scoping**
   - Nav bar shows a distinct colored badge per role (Admin/Operator/User) and hides nav links a role can't use
   - All 22 traffic zones are real Bangalore locations (previously scattered across 4 different Indian cities — a real bug this fix caught, since cross-city "routes" were meaningless)

**New tables introduced:** `traffic_predictions`, `incident_reports`, `saved_routes`

**New endpoints introduced:**

| Method | Endpoint | Access |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/predict/congestion` | Authenticated |
| GET | `/predict/reports` | Authenticated |
| POST | `/routes/optimize` | Authenticated |
| POST | `/routes/saved` | Authenticated |
| GET | `/routes/saved` | Authenticated |
| DELETE | `/routes/saved/{id}` | Authenticated |
| POST | `/incidents` | Operator/Admin |
| GET | `/incidents` | Authenticated |
| PATCH | `/incidents/{id}/resolve` | Operator/Admin |

**Roles & permissions:**

| Role | Zones (write) | Predict / Routes | Report incidents | View incidents |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| `admin` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `operator` | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `user` | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |

## Setup & Running

### 1. Backend

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # Windows: venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install "bcrypt==4.0.1" --force-reinstall

cp .env.example .env            # then edit .env with your PostgreSQL credentials
```

`.env` fields:
```
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=your_password_here
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=trafficvision
```
> Passwords with special characters (`@`, `:`, `/`, `#`) are safe — `database.py` URL-encodes them automatically.

Create the database (one-time):
```bash
psql -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE trafficvision;"
```

Run the API:
```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```
Docs at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

> **Schema changes require a full reset.** `Base.metadata.create_all()` only creates tables that don't exist — it never alters existing ones. After pulling any update that changes `models.py`:
> ```bash
> psql -U postgres -d trafficvision -c "DROP SCHEMA public CASCADE; CREATE SCHEMA public;"
> ```

### 2. Simulator (seeds data)

In a second terminal:
```bash
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate
python simulator.py
```
Creates a bootstrap admin (`admin@trafficvision.ai` / `admin123`), seeds 22 Bangalore zones, streams live readings every 5s.

### 3. Frontend

In a third terminal:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
Visit `http://localhost:5173`. Log in as admin, or sign up as a new Public User / Traffic Operator.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `AttributeError: module 'app.auth' has no attribute 'get_current_user'` | Wrong content in `app/auth.py` — see the warning section above | Restore from the Reference section below, verify with `Select-String` |
| `password authentication failed for user "postgres"` | `.env` password doesn't match your actual PostgreSQL password | Confirm with `psql` directly, update `.env` to match |
| `could not translate host name "X@localhost"` | Special character in password wasn't URL-encoded | Already handled by `quote_plus` in `database.py` |
| `500` on `/auth/signup` | `bcrypt`/`passlib` version mismatch | `pip install "bcrypt==4.0.1" --force-reinstall` |
| `column "X" does not exist` / `UndefinedColumn` | `models.py` changed but DB wasn't reset | Full schema reset (see Setup section above) |
| Frontend "module not found" after pulling an update | New npm dependency (e.g. Leaflet) wasn't installed | Re-run `npm install`, even if `node_modules` exists |
| Route optimization returns `502` | OSRM's public demo server unreachable | Retry; for production, self-host OSRM or switch providers |
| `uvicorn: command not found` after activating venv | `pip install -r requirements.txt` never completed (often because it was run from the wrong folder) | `cd` into `backend` first, confirm with `pwd`, then reinstall |

## Design Notes & Known Limitations

- **PostgreSQL via SQLAlchemy ORM**: fully decoupled from the specific database engine.
- **No migration tool**: `create_all()` doesn't alter existing tables — a real production gap, would use Alembic in a production system.
- **City-wide congestion proxy**: route ETA adjustment uses an average of recent readings across all zones, not per-route-segment congestion.
- **OSRM public demo server**: not meant for production traffic (no uptime guarantee); self-hosting or a paid provider is the natural upgrade.
- **Polling over WebSockets**: simpler for this project's scope; a documented tradeoff for future real-time work.

---

## Roadmap

- **Week 5–6 (Milestone 3):** Analytics dashboard with heatmaps and historical trend analysis, building on incident reports and prediction history already being logged
- **Week 7–8:** Deployment (Docker/cloud), performance tuning, final polish
